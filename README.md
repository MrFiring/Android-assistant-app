# Android assistant (2015)
The app has a list of actions. When the user taps an item of the list, app sends a command to the [server](https://github.com/MrFiring/Android-Assistant-Server/blob/main/README.md) (PC) and the server
emulates predefined user input such as: keyboard button press, turn up/down the volume, etc.
